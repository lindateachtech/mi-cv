Therefore, we develop a semi-automated and transferable workflow implemented within a Python package. We analyse the challenges related to radar interferometry for DEM gener-ation for selected large landslides with different characteristics in Austria and Norway. The quality of the DEMs is evaluated in comparison with reference data, and the proposed workflow is assessed in terms of reliability, performance, reproducibility, and transferability. The preliminary results are promising, however, the quality of the DEMs varies between the study areas. Hence, further re-search is necessary to enhance DEM quality to provide accurate and reliable landslide volume esti-mations. The findings contribute to increasing our knowledge of the applicability of Sentinel-1 DEMs for natural hazard research, particularly for landslide volume estimation.},

   abstract = {Extensive road construction works recently took place in the remote eastern part of the Peruvian Cordillera Blanca, aiming at a better connection of isolated mountain communities with regional administrative centres. Here we document and characterize landslides associated with these road construction efforts in the Río Lucma catchment, Peru. We show that a total area of 321,332 m2 has been affected by landslides along the 47.1 km of roads constructed between 2015 and 2018. While landslides downslope the roads (48.2%) and complex landslides crossing the roads (46.4%) were the most frequent landslide types in relation to the position of the road; slide-type movement (60.7%) prevails over the flow-type movement (39.3%). Timewise, we found that 75.0% of landslides were observed simultaneously with road construction work, while the remaining 25.0% occurred up to seven months after the roads had been constructed. We plotted the lagged occurrence of these subsequent landslides against precipitation data, showing that 85.7% of them were observed during the wet season (November to April). We conclude that the majority of mapped landslides were directly associated with road constructions and that the road constructions also may set preconditions for landslides, which mainly occurred during the subsequent wet season.},

   abstract = {The alpine infrastructure of trails and huts enables access to the Alps and is an essential element of summer tourism. Mass movements, whose frequency and magnitude are expected to increase due to extreme rainfall events associated with climate change, frequently affect this infrastructure. Alpine associations need to adopt new ways within their management and maintenance to cope with the expected effects. An option is the use of susceptibility maps to assess the impact of mass movements on the alpine infrastructure network at a regional scale. Thus, this study aimed to assess the mass movement susceptibility of alpine hut and trail infrastructure in a popular hiking area in the Salzkammergut region in Austria. Two statistical susceptibility mapping approaches (logistic regression and informative value) were applied, assessed for their accuracy, and compared. The susceptibility of the alpine infrastructure to mass movements was calculated for trails and huts. Field validation was performed in a mass movement hotspot within the study area. The resulting mass movement susceptibility maps show similar patterns for areas with low and high susceptibility for both methods but are influenced by the completeness of the mass movement inventory and the quality of the conditioning factors. Both methods presented a prediction rate above 68%, with a higher rate for the logistic regression method. The informative value, however, presented more reliable results during the field validation. Discussions with Alpine associations show the potential of susceptibility mapping to aid strategic alpine infrastructure management by providing an overview of susceptible alpine trails and huts.},

   abstract = {Contributory citizen science projects face challenges regarding data quantity and quality. To counteract this, the projects must be centred around citizen needs and preferences, while considering aspects such as the data contribution process, including instructions, project promotion, information provision, feedback and recognition, and the design of the respective elements. Based on an understanding of the relevance of these issues affecting data contribution systems, we must determine which elements we can use to meet citizens’ needs and preferences and how to better tailor the system design to citizens’ requirements. The citizenMorph project, which aimed to create a pilot system for citizens to collect and report data on landforms, focused on the development of a citizen-centric system with elements that foster and encourage citizen engagement. We used a specifically conceived development workflow that combined participatory design with the prototyping model to involve citizen representatives in different ways and to different degrees in requirement specification, system design and implementation, and testing. This allowed citizens’ requirements to be specified and comprehensively considered in the citizenMorph system. Based on the input of citizens who were involved in the development process, the citizenMorph pilot system includes a data contribution application and a project-related website with several project-specific elements that focus on attracting and recruiting citizens to participate and increase their initial and ongoing engagement and willingness to report landform data. This includes traditional and web-based promotion elements, a specifically designed information strategy that considers information detail, depth and presentation media, project and task-tailored data contribution instructions and support, and the possibility for users to find and view the data they contributed on a web map.},

Thus, better knowledge about the evolution of landslides and their impact on the downstream area is of high importance for disaster mitigation. The aim of this study is twofold: (1) to semi-automatically map the evolution of the Butangbunasi landslide in south-central Taiwan using satellite remote sensing data, and (2) to investigate the potential correlation between changes in landslide area and heavy rainfall during typhoon events. Landslide area, as well as temporary landslide-dammed lakes, were semi-automatically identified using object-based image analysis (OBIA), based on 20 Landsat images from 1984 to 2018. Hourly rainfall data from the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau (CWB) was complemented with rainfall data from Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) to examine the potential relationship between landslide area changes and rainfall as a triggering factor. The OBIA mapping results revealed that the most significant landslide extension happened after typhoon Morakot in 2009. We found a moderate positive relationship between the landslide area change and the duration of the heavy rainfall event, whereas daily precipitation, cumulative rainfall and mean intensity did not present strong significant correlations.},

Landslides can block rivers and create landslide-dammed lakes, which pose a significant risk for downstream areas. In this research, we used an object-based image analysis approach to map geomorphological features and related changes and assess the applicability of Sentinel-1 data for the fast creation of post-event digital elevation models (DEMs) for landslide volume estimation. We investigated the Hítardalur landslide, which occurred on the 7 July 2018 in western Iceland, along with the geomorphological changes induced by this landslide, using optical and synthetic aperture radar data from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1. The results show that there were no considerable changes in the landslide area between 2018 and 2019. However, the landslide-dammed lake area shrunk between 2018 and 2019. Moreover, the Hítará river diverted its course as a result of the landslide. The DEMs, generated by ascending and descending flight directions and three orbits, and the subsequent volume estimation revealed that—without further post-processing—the results need to be interpreted with care since several factors influence the DEM generation from Sentinel-1 imagery.},

   abstract = {Citizen science, aiming at integrating citizens, their commitment and knowledge into scientific research, is a powerful way to create additional research outputs and scientific knowledge. This is particularly true when geospatial technology is used to enable citizens to contribute spatial data. While fields such as biology and ecology make abundant use of geo citizen science, only a limited number of projects approach topics related to geomorphology. Due to climate change and its impact on the Earth’s surface, research activities that use citizen science are considered very useful to support the work of geomorphologists. However, geomorphology is a complex topic to engage with citizens. Thus, to reach and involve citizens in geomorphological research, we need spatial data collection tools that are tailored to their needs and raise their interest in geomorphology. For this, participatory design is a valuable option since it allows us to get comprehensive information about citizens and their requirements and to integrate this information into the development process. Now, does participatory design reveal requirements otherwise unknown to the developers? What additional efforts must be made when cooperating with citizens in participatory design? The citizenMorph project, which addresses these questions, found that detailed and valuable insights can be gained (regarding, e.g., information delivery, design issues, and community building), but also that additional efforts are required in terms of the composition of the project team, the interaction and communication during the development process, and the selection of methods, tools and material to be used.},

We characterize the resulting landslide deposits with commonly used metrics, investigate their relation to glacial land-forming and tectonic units, and discuss the roles of the drainage system and valley shape. We discover that modeled landslide dams and lakes cover a wide volume range. In line with real-world inventories, we further found that lake volume increases linearly with landslide volume in the case of efficient damming - when an exceptionally large lake is dammed by a relatively small landslide deposit. The distribution and size of potential landslide dams and lakes depends strongly on local topographic relief. For a given landslide volume, lake size depends on drainage area and valley geometry. The largest lakes form in glacial troughs, while the most efficient damming occurs where landslides block a gorge downstream of a wide valley, a situation preferentially encountered at the transition between two different tectonic units. Our results also contain inefficient damming events, a damming type that exhibits different scaling of landslide and lake metrics than efficient damming and is hardly reported in inventories. We assume that such events also occur in the real world and emphasize that their documentation is needed to better understand the effects of landsliding on the drainage system.},

Based on field observations and analysis of historical photographs (since 1932) and remotely sensed images (since 1948), we interpret distinct mechanisms of landslides in these moraines and link them to glacier retreat and thinning. Three types of landslides are distinguished according to the cross-profile morphology: (i) type “N”, (ii) type “M” and (iii) type “A”. Our data show that sliding of type “N” is an ice-contact slope failure that occurs as a gradual process simultaneously to glacier downwasting. In contrast, type “A” can occur at any time once the glacier has downwasted below the sliding plane and cannot buttress the nearly vertical inner slopes of the moraine anymore. We further argue that the type “M” can gradually evolve from type “N” or can occur as an episodic event. Probably due to overconsolidation of moraine material, landslides of types “N” and “M” keep their shape during sliding and move in form of several hundred meters long unbroken blocks. In contrast type “A” is internally disintegrated during landsilding. All investigated landslide types are characterized by increased width-length ratio and movement perpendicular to the direction of the flow of the glacier. We opine that the occurrence of these landslide types is directly or indirectly associated with glacial ice loss occurring since the end of the LIA. The observed landslides in the LIA moraines of the Kinzl Glacier are unique in the regional context considering their estimated size on the order of 106 m3 and contribute significantly to the paraglacial adjustment of moraine slopes and landform evolution in the post-LIA context.

   abstract = {Abstract. In August 2009, Typhoon Morakot caused a record-breaking rainfall in Taiwan. The heavy rainfall triggered thousands of landslides, in particular in the central-southern part of the island. Large landslides can block rivers and can lead to the formation of landslide-dammed lakes. Cascading hazards like floods and debris flows after landslide dam breaches pose a high risk for people and infrastructure downstream. Thus, better knowledge about landslides that significantly impact the channel system and about the resulting landslide-dammed lakes are key elements for assessing the direct and indirect hazards caused by the moving mass. The main objectives of this study are 1) to develop an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach for semi-automated detection of landslides that caused the formation of landslide-dammed lakes and 2) to monitor the evolution of landslide-dammed lakes based on Landsat imagery. For landslide and lake mapping, primarily spectral indices and contextual information were used. By integrating morphological and hydrological parameters derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) into the OBIA framework, we automatically identified landslide-dammed lakes, and the landslides that likely caused the formation of those lakes, due to the input of large amounts of debris into the channel system. The proposed approach can be adapted to other remote sensing platforms and can be used to monitor the evolution of landslide-dammed lakes and triggering landslides at regional scale after typhoon and heavy rainstorm events within an efficient time range after suitable remote sensing data has been provided.},

   abstract = {Abstract. Digital elevation models (DEMs) serve as a basis for various geomorphological applications, such as, landform mapping, natural hazard assessment, and landslide characterisation. The inter-comparison of DEMs can be used to provide estimates of topographic change, for example, volume changes. Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can be used to generate multitemporal topographic datasets using interferometric SAR (InSAR). Such analyses are often conducted using commercial software; however, a well-structured workflow based on free and open-source software (FOSS) increases the applicability and transferability of the DEM generation method and can facilitate the use of multi-temporal topographic analysis within the Earth Sciences. In this study, we aim to develop an open-source-based workflow for the generation of multi-temporal DEMs from Sentinel-1 data, and to explore their potential for landslide volume estimation using FOSS. We implemented this semi-automated and transferable workflow bundled in the open-source Python package “SliDEM”, which relies on SNAP, SNAPHU, and several other open-source software for geospatial and geomorphological applications, all distributed within a Docker image. Two major landslides in Austria and Norway were selected to test, evaluate, and validate the workflow in terms of reliability, performance, reproducibility, and transferability. Even if the quality of the Sentinel-1-based DEMs varies among the study areas, the preliminary results are promising. However, there is a need for improvement and thorough analysis of the causes of elevation errors. A comprehensive evaluation of the influence of the perpendicular and temporal baselines, topography, land use/land cover, and other environmental conditions can be systematically assessed within the “SliDEM” workflow.},

   abstract = {Abstract. On July 7, 2018, a large landslide occurred at the eastern slope of the Fagraskógarfjall Mountain in Hítardalur valley in West Iceland. The landslide dammed the river, led to the formation of a lake and, consequently, to a change in the river course. The main focus of this research is to develop a knowledge-based expert system using an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach for identifying morphology changes caused by the Hítardalur landslide. We use synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing data, in particular from Sentinel-1/2 for detection of the landslide and its effects on the river system. We extracted and classified the landslide area, the landslide-dammed lake, other lakes and the river course using intensity information from S1 and spectral information from S2 in the object-based framework. Future research will focus on further developing this approach to support mapping and monitoring of the spatio-temporal dynamics of surface morphology in an object-based framework by combining SAR and optical data. The results can reveal details on the applicability of different remote sensing data for the spatio-temporal investigation of landslides, landslide-induced river course changes and lake formation and lead to a better understanding of the impact of large landslides on river systems.},

   abstract = {Cycling has been considered a viable option to generate a modal shift from fossil dependent transportation modes. In this framework, measurements and tools that aid connected bicycle infrastructure planning have been developed. This is the case of the Bicycle Network Analysis score, a connectivity measure adapted for the U.S. It is based on the Levels of Traffic Stress methodology and computed mainly with OpenStreetMap data. Its aim is to quantify how well the low-stress bicycle network in a city connects people with the places they want to go. For this research, the BNA open source tool is adapted to a European context to validate its ability of quantifying low-stress connectivity. Three core elements are evaluated: stress network, destinations, and the overall score itself. They are related to cycling behaviors from two validation data sources: travel to work data in England and Wales, and crowdsourced bicycle trip routes in The Netherlands. The results indicate that in England and Wales, there is a significantly higher percentage of bicycle trips performed between origin-destination pairs with a low-stress connection between them. Additionally, a positive correlation is found between the percentage of bicycle trips within a city and its overall BNA score. In the Dutch case, the destinations core element is evaluated, determining that the destinations contemplated in the BNA score calculation are also among the highly frequented by cyclists. However, their importance within the score computation might require adjustments. Although a comprehensive validation cannot be achieved due to data limitations, evidence that providing low-stress connections between origins and destinations relates to bicycle commuting in cities is found. Therefore, special attention should be given to those measures that can greatly benefit the decision-making process when planning for sustainable cities.},

Lisbon is no exception, as it invests in the implementation of new bike infrastructure. Quantifying the connectivity of such a bicycle network can help evaluate its current state and highlight specific challenges that should be addressed. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop an exploratory score that allows a quantification of the bicycle network connectivity in Lisbon based on open data. For each part of the city, a score was computed based on how many common destinations (e.g., schools, universities, supermarkets, hospitals) were located within an acceptable biking distance when using only bicycle lanes and roads with low traffic stress for cyclists. Taking a weighted average of these scores resulted in an overall score for the city of Lisbon of only 8.6 out of 100 points. This shows, at a glance, that the city still has a long way to go before achieving their objectives regarding bicycle use in the city.},
